# HTML Practice Folder

This folder contains my HTML practice exercises as part of my frontend development learning journey.

## Purpose
- Practice building semantic HTML pages
- Learn proper HTML structure, headings, paragraphs, lists, and sections
- Explore embedding external content like videos and maps

## Structure
- `video-compilation/` – A small project showcasing embedded YouTube videos and semantic HTML (includes a separate README for details)
- Other HTML files – Individual practice exercises for learning and experimentation

## Notes
- Most exercises are HTML-only (no CSS yet)
- This folder serves as a record of my learning progress
- Projects are structured for readability and gradual improvement
